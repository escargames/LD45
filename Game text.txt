Granma on the beach: "Hey there! What a storm huh? My two grand-daughters are so light and tiny they were lifted by the wind!
If by any chance you find them on your way, would you be kind enough to send them back to me? I have been worrying like hell.

Heart: "You are right, I should take care of myself and try not to worry too much. Thank you, it helps to know that I am not alone."
Interrogation point: "
Excalamation point: "They sure are ressourcefull little girls! I would not be surprised if they found their way home by themselves!"

Person near house: "Good morning! Did the storm do any damage to your lovely home? I just can't believe my beloved plants are still intact!
I heard the storm destroyed a house near the lake, I am going there to help rebuilding it! Can you water my plants while I am gone?

Heart: "Thank you so much! My plants mean so much to me. Taking care of them and watching them grow is my biggest joy in the world."
Interrogation point: "Don't worry, I am sure you will find it very easy and relaxing! You will do great."
Exclamation point: "Aww, I didn't know you loved gardening too! We should get together sometimes when I come back, I would love to hear
about your plants."
